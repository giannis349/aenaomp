    "description": "The pyramids of Egypt date back to the Ancient Egyptian civilization, which began around 3,000 BC. During that time, Egypt was ruled by kings known as pharaohs. Most of the landscape of Egypt is hot, dry desert, and so the Ancient Egyptians usually lived near the river Nile where the land was most fertile. We know about the Ancient Egyptians from the pyramids they built, as well as underground tombs, mummies, art, and writing. The best known pyramids of Egypt are found in Giza in northern Egypt, near the capital city of Cairo. There are three main pyramids at Giza, each built for a different pharaoh. These are some of the largest structures ever built in the world. In this virtual experience, you will visit the Pyramids of Giza and learn about life in Ancient Egypt.",

The tomb was plundered by thieves, who took most of the treasures, as well as the sarcophagus and most of Nefertari’s mummy. Later, in 1904, the tomb was rediscovered by Ernesto Schiapernelli, who worked for the Museum of Egypt in Turin. He found parts of mummified legs and took them back with him to the museum.
